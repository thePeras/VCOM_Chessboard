# Chessboard Computer Vision

## Task 1

#### Input:
- Image with chessboard

#### Output:
- Total number of black/white pieces on the board
- Position of the pieces on the image (bounding boxes)
- Position of the pieces on the board (8x8 matrix with 0/1 values representing absence/presence of piece - any board orientation is acceptable) 

#### Dataset:
- 50 images randomly chosen from a public dataset
https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/99b5c721-280b-450b-b058-b2900b69a90f/2
- The results will be tested in 10 undisclosed images

#### Deliverables:
- Short report (2 pages max) presenting the methodology and some results
- Python script (only one file)

#### Evaluation:
- Accounts for 30% of the overall project grade
- Elements being considered: methodology, report and quality of the results

#### Important remarks
- Follow strictly the JSON structure for the input and output files
- It is okay to use AI tools while developing your work, but it is not okay to use them without acknowledging it
- All members of the group are expected to understand the methodology and the submitted code
