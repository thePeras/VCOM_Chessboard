**Important Note:** The `board_matrix` represents the chessboard oriented with the black knight logo (horse) in the bottom left corner of the physical board.

For our project, we can predict the positions in any orientation, so in our verification process, we should consider all the possible orientations of the board. I did it this way so that in the future if we want to predict the positions in respect to the black knight logo, we can do it easily.
